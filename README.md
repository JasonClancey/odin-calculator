The Odin Project - Calculator

This is a basic calculator. It is able to add, subtract, multiply, and divide two numbers and then display the results. Has functionality for a percent button,
positive and negative values, can clear its values, and chain add/subtract/etc. 

Great learning experience. If I revisit this in the future there is a lot of room to improve / clean up the code.
